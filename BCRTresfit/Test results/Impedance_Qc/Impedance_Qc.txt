In this set of data generated in AWR, an impedance mismatch was created using an inductor with changing inductance to create complex impedance. Here, data is shown
using both fits (DCM & INV) for three different impedance values (impedance in the transmission line) each taken across different values of Qc which is changed by 
altering the coupling capacitance for the circiut in AWR. One can see from these graphs that the impedance does not seem to have a large effect on percent error of 
these fits and that Qc appears to be of greater concern when attempting to find the sources that contribute the highest percent error. Considering that the points 
not exceeding a ratio of 100 for Qi/Qc do not appear to have considerable error (above 2%) it is safe to say that for this Qi of 1113555, as long as Qc and Qi are 
within two orders of magnitude of each other, the fitting appears to be very accurate.
