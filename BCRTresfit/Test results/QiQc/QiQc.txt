Here, three lines are shown for three different Qi values each taken across changing Qc values. Qc is altered by changing coupling capacitance in AWR. 

DCM.png illustrates that there appears to be a range of Qi/Qc where the accuracy of Qi is high for the DCM fit. This range appears to be between 10^-2 and 10 for Qi
on the order of 10^2, between 10^-2 and 10^2 for Qi on the order of 10^4, and between 10^-2 and 10^3 for Qi on the order of 10^6. In short, it appears that as long as
Qc and Qi are within two orders of magnitude from each other, the result will be quite accurate for determining Qi.

Similary for INV.png, there appears to be another range of Qi/Qc where the accuracy of Qi is high. This range appears to be the same as the DCM fitting image for Qi
on the order of 10^2 and clear limits where the percent error goes above 2% are not shown in this graph for the other two Qi values.

These graphs demonstrate that the INV fitting method appears to be more robust across high and low Qi/Qc ratios.
