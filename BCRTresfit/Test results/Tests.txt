The model used here is a simple lumped element resonator RCL circuit capacitively coupled to a transmission line with data generated in AWR.
Asymmetry is added by increasing inductance on one side of the transmission line and Qc is changed by varying the value of the coupling capacitor.
The value for Qi is changed here by varying the value of R in the RCL circuit and Qi_SIM is calculated using the known simulation parameters.

Tests:
Extract factor- Test to see how big of a difference using a certain number of 3dB bandwidths to fit data makes
Impedance_Qc- Test to see what kind of a difference changing coupling capacitance and impedance mismatch makes
Normalize Bandwidths- Test to see how percent error changes when using different numbers of 3dB bandwidths to normalize data
PHI Test- Find out how big of a difference there is between Phi Rotation Method and DCM
QiQc- Test how changing coupling capacitance makes for different values of Qi
