As displayed in R=1e6.png, the percent error in Qi versus number of 3dB bandwidths used to normalize data at a Qi on the order of 10^4 shows that percent error
becomes effectively negligible past 4 3dB bandwidths used. This is indicated by the rapid change in percent error between 3 and 4 bandwidths used. For this specific 
Qi, the reason for the rapid change is that the fitting parameters are getting stuck in a local minimum for DCM. This causes the Monte Carlo fit function to get 
better results and leads to a high percent error due to the nature of Monte Carlo fits.

In the case of R=1e8.png, the number of 3dB bandwidths used for normalization using roughly the same number of points for both INV and DCM was tested. These
results indicate that DCM is not as reliable at low number of bandwidths used. This is due to the fact that the INV fitting uses less points, the ones near resonance,
wich grants the fit better accuracy. Using the same points would give a similar accuracy for DCM, however, because the definitions of 3dB bandwidth change between
fits DCM ends up using more points (the ones further from resonance). Note that in a real measurement, it is possible that noise could affect the accuracy quite 
heavily in the case of INV because it uses a fewer number of points as a result of the definition of it's 3dB bandwidth.

Note that an attempt was made to test this normalization for a Qi on the order of 10^2, however the necessary number of 3dB bandwidths needed in order to get decent
results (within double the expected value) with this fitting is on the order of 10^2. It does not appear possible to get a reasonable baseline and points near 
resonance at the same time for a Qi on this order unless a very large number of points are taken.
