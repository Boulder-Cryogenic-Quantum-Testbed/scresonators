Here data was generated from AWR and an impedance mismatch was created by varying the inductance of an inductor in the transmission line to create complex impedance.
The Diameter Correction Method and the Phi Rotation Method are both graphed with their respective percent error for three Qi values across changing impedance
mismatches. Note that while Qi changes due to the impedance mismatch, the actual change is very small (less than 0.01% across the 40 Ohm span, see mathematica file 
for equation to calculate loaded frequency which can be used to calculate Qi) and can be neglected for the calculation of percent error for these results considering
the scale of percent error being graphed. It is clear from the results that the Phi Rotation Method has a large percent error when exposed to an environment of high 
impedance mismatch, above even 30 percent for the 11135 Qi resonator. This matches with results we would expect as the DCM is the corrected version of the Phi 
Rotation Method to account for impedance mismatches.
