##Detect Format:

A simple script to detect if the user's data file is of the correct format.

This code will check for:

* Header (not currently part of standard format)
* Correct number of columns
* Correct delimiter (currently set to ',')
* Containing more than 1 line of data
* Frequency in GHz (determined by checking if frequency is above 10^8 in magnitude)
* Phase in radians (determined by checking if phase less/greater than 2pi)

>Code does not check if magnitude is in dB

The code will prompt the user to check if they would like to make a new file with an edited version of their data using the correct format for each individual change.
