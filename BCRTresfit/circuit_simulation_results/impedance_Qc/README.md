## Impedance Qc Test:

This test shows the accuracy of the fit as a function of Qi/Qc for various impedance values.

## Data:

One can see from these graphs that the impedance does not seem to have a large effect on percent error on its own. However, in combination with Qi/Qc ratios around 
2 orders of magnitude above/below 1, the error can become considerable and thus Qc appears to be of greater concern when attempting to find the sources that 
contribute to highest percent error.
Considering that the points not exceeding a ratio of 100 for Qi/Qc do not appear to have considerable error (above 2%) it is safe to say that for this Qi of 1113555,
as long as Qc and Qi are within two orders of magnitude of each other, the fitting is quite accurate.
