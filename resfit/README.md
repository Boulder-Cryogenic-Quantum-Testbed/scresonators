## Starting Notes

This code is made to fit complex S21 data for hangar type resonators using the Diameter Correction Method (DCM), Inverse S21 method (INV), Closest Pole and Zero Method (CPZM), and Phi Rotation Method (PHI) fittings

Additionally, the code is able to fit reflection type geometry resonators with an altered version of the Diameter Correction Method (DCM REFLECTION)

## Fitting Functions:

## INPUT:
The code takes in a .csv file (accepts .txt as well), containing 3 columns separated by commas where each line represents one point of data
   >Note that as of right now, headers are not accepted in this file, the code only accepts the data with no header (currently planning to add header support 2/3/2020)

1. The first column is monotonically increasing frequency in GHz
1. The second column is magnitude of S21 in dB (log mag)
1. The third column is phase of S21 in radians
   >More information regarding standard data format can be found here https://github.com/Boulder-Cryogenic-Resonator-Testbed/measurement/issues/19

The user has the option of including a background removal file in order to have a more accurate fit. This is recommended if the background is not linear.
   >Background file needs to be of the same format as the main data file as described with the three columns above.

User needs to ensure that the data has at least 20 points otherwise the code will fail

If user does not include points near off resonance in addition to points near resonance, fitting will not be accurate and could fail entirely
   >In simple terms: The fitting needs a full circle (in complex plane) to work optimally

## OUTPUT:

All output will be put in a new folder titled with a timestamp in the folder with the user's data.

1. If the user has a background removal file, the code will output graphs displaying the main data and the background for both the magnitude and phase
1. The code will output four figures showing the steps it is taking to normalize the data titled Normalize_1 through Normalize_4
1. If the user opted to have the code guess initial parameters, the code will output three figures showing the steps taken to find resonance and phi guesses
1. The code outputs a figure displaying a variety of information regarding how the fit was completed. This includes a plot of both the raw and final fit of data
in the complex plane, plots of the linear fits that normalize the data for both magnitude and phase, plots of the normalized magnitude and phase with their final
fits, manually input guess parameters, and the final parameters found from the fit with their 95% confidence intervals.
1. The code will also print a .csv file displaying the information that the fit has gathered with each term on a new line:
    * DCM/DCM REFLECTION/PHI: Q, Qi, Qc, 1/Re[1/Qc], phi, f_c
    * INV: Qi, Qc*, phi, f_c
    * CPZM: Qi, Qc, Qa, f_c

>User has the option of disabling extra graphs such as the normalization process graphs when calling the fit_resonator function

## Code Overview

1. From user python file, code takes in user data file name along with the associated directory and passes it to Fit_Resonator function along with user preferences and an optional background removal file name
1. If user has a background file, the code will use it to remove the background for a more accurate fit
1. Data is pre-processed using a linear fit for both magnitude and phase of S21 so that start and end points of S21 data are at (1,0i) in the complex plane
1. If the user does not manually initialize a guess, the code will attempt to find a guess for fit parameters using Find_initial_guess function
1. Once the code has a guess for fit parameters, it will crop the data to points near resonance
1. After cropping, the code will minimize the guess parameters based on data points using a least squares fit then compare parameters to a Monte Carlo fit
   >This step will be repeated until the Monte Carlo fit does not give better results than the minimization.
   >Monte Carlo fit is meant to check if fitting parameters are trapped in a local minimum.
   >If Monte Carlo fit got better results, the parameters obtained from Monte Carlo fit will be minimized.

1. The 95% confidence interval is found for the fit and the range of values for the interval is reported as the error in the final plot
1. At this point the final parameter values have been found and fitting is complete. Final fitting is plotted and fit parameters are written to a .csv file

## Installation

User will need the following python modules:
* attr
* inflect
* lmfit
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* sympy

To install these modules, the user can run the following command from the measurement directory:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

> Alternatively to the requirements.txt, user can install a module with "pip install ______" on the command line for python 3.
Must install pip module before installing pips for python 2. Once pip is installed for python 2, install modules the same way as python 3.

## USER INPUT FILE

###### An example of the way the following is done is included in the example file (User_Example.py)

#### Section 1: Initial Setup

###### The user will need to set the "dir" variable equal to the directory of folder containing user file. This can be done with the command:

`dir = "your path to data folder here"`

###### User will need to set the "filename" variable to the name of their file with:
`filename = 'your name here.csv'`
   >Note that code accepts both .txt and .csv file formats

#### Section 2: Setting Fit Variables

###### User must initialize a Fit_Method class instance with arguments: 
* fit_type
* MC_iteration
* MC_rounds
* MC_fix
* manual_init
* MC_step_const

fit_type: 'DCM','DCM REFLECTION','PHI','INV' or 'CPZM' for the method user wishes to run

MC_iteration: The number of times the user wants the Monte Carlo fit to run

MC_rounds: The number of iterations the Monte Carlo fit will do per run. Default is 100 if not defined

MC_fix: An array of which variables the MC fit will not change during iteration.
   >An example of MC_fix is as follows:
   `MC_fix = ['w1','Qi']`
   >The strings user can use for MC_fix are as follows: 'Q','Qi','Qc','w1','phi','Qa'

manual_init: Used to define initial guess variables
   >If the user wants to have the program auto guess parameters, they can set manual_init equal to None
   
   >If the user wants to define their own initial guess parameters, they must define it in the following format: 
   `manual_init = [1,2,3,4]`
    1 = Qi
    2 = Qc
    3 = resonance frequency (GHz)
    4 = phi (radians) or Qa (Qa only used for CPZM)

> Note that if using CPZM, 4 needs to be Qa not phi. If using any other method, 4 needs to be phi.

MC_step_const: Range for the random parameter values chosen in MC fit. This scaling is exponential. The larger this number, the higher and lower the random values

#### Section 3: Fitting Data

The user calls the Fit_Resonator function with:

`params1,fig1,chi1,init1 = fsd.Fit_Resonator(filename = filename,Method = Method,normalize = normalize,dir = dir)`

If the user wants to have the code remove their background, they need to include the path to their background removal file as well with:

`params1,fig1,chi1,init1 = Fit_Resonator(filename = filename,Method = Method,normalize = normalize,dir = dir,background = background_file)`

   >Here it is assumed that dir is the same directory for both the user's main data file and the background and can thus be used for both

normalize: The number of points from the start/end of S21 data the user wants to use in the linear fit of S21 data for magnitude and phase for normalization, set with:

`normalize = 10`
