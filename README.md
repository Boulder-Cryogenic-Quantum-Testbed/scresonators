scresonators code is made to fit complex S21 data for hangar mode resonators. The scresonators library supports fitting using the Diameter Correction Method (DCM), Inverse S21 method (INV), Closest Pole and Zero Method (CPZM), and Phi Rotation Method (PHI). Additionally, the code is able to fit reflection type geometry resonators with an altered version of the Diameter Correction Method (DCM REFLECTION).



Code Installation
-------------------------

We ***strongly*** recommend using [virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) for managing your dependences.

scresonators can be installed via pip by running
```
pip install scresonators-fit
```
To use the module lead your Python code with
```
import fit_resonator.resonator as resonator
```
